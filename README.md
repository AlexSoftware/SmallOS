SmallOS
=======

Small "OS" written on C++. It's only small interpreter now, without any security now (all passwords stores w/o any encryption). But this project will grow up and update. You can try using it by cloning file "/Debug/test.exe", or build it yourself from sources.
Source files (.cpp and .h) is in /test folder, also there is folder "Debug" with some Visual Studio debug files (I don't know what they are doing, but my project didn't compiled without it).
